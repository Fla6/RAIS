                        <p> 
                            Do you ever feel like when someone asks what’s on your mind, you can’t give an answer? 
                            Not because you don’t want to, but because there is just so much? I’ve been struggling 
                            writing this post (this is the fourth rewrite!) because there is so much happening not 
                            only in my life, but in the world. The women representing Peru in the Miss Universe 
                            competition citing facts about crimes against women in Peru instead of their measurements, 
                            France placing a ban on underweight models, multiple shootings this week alone, sexual 
                            harassment cases emerging in Hollywood at a rapid pace, Disney’s first gay storyline 
                            in popular television series Andi Mack; it can be really overwhelming just opening a 
                            web browser. How could I pick just one topic to write about?
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            That’s when I realized what I needed to write about wasn’t each specific topic, but as a 
                                whole, the constant bombardment of new facts in our ever-changing society. I constantly 
                                check my email, my text messages, Instagram, Facebook. I want to be a journalist! There’s 
                                no better way to be in the media then being the media. But even with my aspirations, 
                                sometimes I just want to unplug. To curl up in bed and read a really good book. Or listen 
                                to the sound of rain. Or go on an adventure in the park with my friends. But I still care 
                                about what’s happening in the world and I want to be a part of it. So how does one find 
                                balance?
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            My sisters and I never received handheld games from our parents. We were encouraged to go 
                                outside and play with friends whenever we got the chance. My family loves taking walks with 
                                my dog, hiking, and finding new places to explore: without technology. For me, a balance 
                                was always easier to find. But I still struggle with the fact that I have a computer in 
                                my room. I could be watching YouTube or looking at headlines instead of cleaning my room 
                                or doing homework. The fact that I have a smartphone. I could be looking at my phone screen 
                                instead of my friends. 
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            I think balance is a new challenge every day. But I think we as women are up to the challenge. 
                                We can use social media to spread our message, like the women in Peru, or to show kindness to 
                                others, as people have all across the country after each and every shooting. We can read the 
                                headlines to figure out how far we’ve come, like the new band in France that makes sure young 
                                girls have healthy role models, or to see how accepting humans can be, like with the gay storyline 
                                from Disney. I’m READY to find balance, are you?
